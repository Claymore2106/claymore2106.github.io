So, its been a while. Far too long in fact. But, I needed to get a job, get a car, and move to a better, cheaper place. All that took a good while and made it 
hard to continue learning about infosec and programming, and to give and update to this blog, mainly because there wasn't a lot to say. Now that life is mostly stable though, 
I can continue. 

While staying active with this stuff was difficult, it wasn't impossible. I ended up looking for a podcast to listen to in the bits of time that I had at home, and for 
while I was at work, since we could use earbuds. I found a great one called 'Security Now' over at [Gibson Research Corporation][grc] that talks a lot about how the Internet 
works, how encryption works, how the two work together, and how certain exploits work. I started from the very beginning (very bottom, 2005) and its very much so worth it. 
Every episode builds on the previous ones, so you could start anywhere but you may miss some stuff. Either way its great, and you should definitely give it a try (don't mind the 
first episode, quality is a bit low but they fix that right quick).

Aside from listening to podcasts, I've been learning Python. I tried Java and C++, but settled on Python because, well, I found I just kept coming back to learn it. C++ was 
incredibly boring, at least in the way it was presented to me. However I see that there is a hell of a lot of potential with it, which is probably why a lot of great programmers
use it. I'll probably try and learn C++ after SQL, after Python, as I want to get a good grip on one language and then see what I can do with it. With SQL, I can start SQL injection 
and actually understand what I'm doing (hopefully). I feel like learning a skill and then applying it to pen testing is a good system, since I'll only be using knowledge I feel 
confident with. I don't want to give myself too much to chew by just throwing everything that exists onto my plate; I've tried stuff like that before and it doesn't end well. 
Anyway if you wanna learn Python, I've been learning over at [Code Academy][ca]. It has a nice layout and presents things in an easy to understand manner. I love it, and hope 
they add more languages in the future. 

There are a few more thins I've been doing, namely cracking my own wifi, but that's a post of its own and I think I'll cover that in my next update, coming sometime this year. 
I'll show you how I installed Kali Linux, captured my packets, and set up my GPUs to crack my password. I'll also hopefully have a method to show you how to crack passwords 
with a crappy laptop that has no Internet connection, but I still have to get that working myself. Once I've got it, I'll write the post for you. But until then, I'm off!
