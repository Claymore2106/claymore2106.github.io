title: Capturing Packets with Aircrack-ng
---

## Setup

Before you can start using Aircrack, you need to set it up, and for that you need to choose which OS will be best for you.
 In the case of Windows, you'll need to assemble your own DLL's, which I wouldn't recommend if you don't know what you're
 doing. For Linux you need to learn how to use the OS, but Aircrack will most likely work out of the box. I recommend
 downloading [Virtualbox][VB] for your current OS, and [picking a Linux distro][distro] to install as the virtual machine.
 This way, you run a computer within a computer. Your current OS is your main, and your Linux machine is just a program.
 
 For this tutorial, I will be using Linux Mint without the VM.
